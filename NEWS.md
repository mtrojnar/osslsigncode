### 2.3 (2022.03.06)

**CRITICAL SECURITY VULNERABILITIES**

This release fixes several critical memory corruption vulnerabilities.
A malicious attacker could create a file, which, when processed with
osslsigncode, triggers arbitrary code execution.  Any previous version
of osslsigncode should be immediately upgraded if the tool is used for
processing of untrusted files.

- fixed several memory safety issues
- fixed non-interactive PVK (MSBLOB) key decryption
- added a bash completion script
- added CA bundle path auto-detection
