osslsigncode
============


== WHAT IS IT?

osslsigncode is a small tool that implements part of the functionality
of the Microsoft tool signcode.exe - more exactly the Authenticode
signing and timestamping. But osslsigncode is based on OpenSSL and cURL, 
and thus should be able to compile on most platforms where these exist.


== WHY?

Why not use signcode.exe? Because I don't want to go to a Windows
machine every time I need to sign a binary - I can compile and build 
the binaries using Wine on my Linux machine, but I can't sign them 
since the signcode.exe makes good use of the CryptoAPI in Windows, and 
these APIs aren't (yet?) fully implemented in Wine, so the signcode.exe 
tool  would fail. And, so, osslsigncode was born.


== WHAT CAN IT DO?

It can sign and timestamp EXE or CAB files. It supports the equivalent 
of signcode.exe's "-j javasign.dll -jp low", i.e. add a valid signature 
for a CAB file containing Java files. It supports getting the timestamp 
through a proxy as well.


== INSTALLATION

The usual way:

  ./configure 
  make
  make install


== USAGE

Before you can sign a file you need a Software Publishing
Certificate (spc) and a corresponding private key. 

This article provides a good starting point as to how
to do the signing with the Microsoft signcode.exe:

  http://www.matthew-jones.com/articles/codesigning.html

To sign with osslsigncode you need the spc file mentioned
in the article above, and you will also need the private
key, but not as a pvk file - it must be a simple key file
on DER format or in PEM format. You can create a DER file 
from the PEM file by doing:

  openssl rsa -passin pass:XXXXX -outform der \
        -in <pem-key-file> -out <der-key-file>

To sign an EXE file you can now do:

  osslsigncode -spc <spc-file> -key <der-key-file> \
        -n "Your Application" -i http://www.yourwebsite.com/ \
        -in yourapp.exe -out yourapp-signed.exe

or if you are using the PEM key file:

  osslsigncode -spc <spc-file> -key <der-key-file> -pass <pem-password> \
        -n "Your Application" -i http://www.yourwebsite.com/ \
        -in yourapp.exe -out yourapp-signed.exe

or if you want to add a timestamp as well:

  osslsigncode -spc <spc-file> -key <der-key-file> \
        -n "Your Application" -i http://www.yourwebsite.com/ \
        -t http://timestamp.verisign.com/scripts/timstamp.dll \
        -in yourapp.exe -out yourapp-signed.exe

You can use an spc and key stored in a PKCS#12 container:

  osslsigncode -pkcs12 <pkcs12-file> -pass <pkcs12-password> \
        -n "Your Application" -i http://www.yourwebsite.com/ \
        -in yourapp.exe -out yourapp-signed.exe

To sign a CAB file containing java class files:

  osslsigncode -spc <spc-file> -key <der-key-file> \
        -n "Your Application" -i http://www.yourwebsite.com/ \
        -jp low \
        -in yourapp.cab -out yourapp-signed.cab

Only the 'low' parameter is currently supported.

You can check that the signed file is correct by right-clicking
on it in Windows and choose Properties --> Digital Signatures,
and then choose the signature from the list, and click on
Details. You should then be presented with a dialog that says
amongst other things that "This digital signature is OK".



== CONVERTING FROM PVK TO DER

(This guide was written by Ryan Rubley)

If you've managed to finally find osslsigncode from some searches, 
you're most likely going to have a heck of a time getting your SPC 
and PVK files into the formats osslsigncode wants. 
 
On the computer where you originally purchased your certificate, you
probably had to use IE to get it. Run IE and select Tools/Internet 
Options from the menu, then under the Content tab, click the Certificates 
button. Under the Personal tab, select your certificate and click the
Export button. On the second page of the wizard, select the PKCS #7 
Certificate (.P7B) format. This file you export as a *.p7b is what you 
use instead of your *.spc file. It's the same basic thing, in a different format. 
 
For your PVK file, you will need to download a little utility called 
PVK.EXE. This can currently be downloaded at

 http://support.globalsign.net/en/objectsign/PVK.zip 

Run: pvk -in foo.pvk -nocrypt -out foo.pem 

This will convert your PVK file to a PEM file. 
From there, you can copy the PEM file to a Linux box, and run: 

  openssl rsa -outform der -in foo.pem -out foo.der 

This will convert your PEM file to a DER file. 
 
You need the *.p7b and *.der files to use osslsigncode, instead of your 
*.spc and *.pvk files.


== BUGS, QUESTIONS etc.

Send an email to mfive@users.sourceforge.net

BUT, if you have questions related to generating spc files, 
converting between different formats and so on, *please* 
spend a few minutes searching on google for your particular 
problem since many people probably already have had your 
problem and solved it as well.
